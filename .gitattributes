# Not JSON5.
# dprint implementation can use features not available in jsonc (e.g., trailing commas),

# Note: Rather than using the file extension ".prototxt",
#       it is better to use other extensions that are default supported by GitHub.
#       E.g., ".textproto", ".pbt", ".pbtxt"
#       see https://github.com/github/linguist/blob/1345d0122a82119ae01abc366346fc9b022cc444/lib/linguist/languages.yml#L5276-L5287
#       ".pbtxt" is recommended. because this is the canonical file extension.
