# GitHub detects only `tsconfig.json` files as jsonc by default.

# However, VSCode also detects `tsconfig.*.json` and `tsconfig-*.json` as jsonc.
# see https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/1.75.1/extensions/typescript-language-features/package.json#L79-L106
# We will also use the latter filename, so we will tell GitHub that these are jsonc.

# The dprint configuration file is parsed as jsonc.

# see https://github.com/dprint/jsonc-parser
# Not JSON5.
# dprint implementation can use features not available in jsonc (e.g., trailing commas),
# but not some JSON5 features (e.g., multi-line strings and `Infinity` values).

# Note: Rather than using the file extension ".prototxt",
#       it is better to use other extensions that are default supported by GitHub.
#       E.g., ".textproto", ".pbt", ".pbtxt"
#       see https://github.com/github/linguist/blob/1345d0122a82119ae01abc366346fc9b022cc444/lib/linguist/languages.yml#L5276-L5287
#       ".pbtxt" is recommended. because this is the canonical file extension.
#       see https://protobuf.dev/reference/protobuf/textformat-spec/#text-format-files
