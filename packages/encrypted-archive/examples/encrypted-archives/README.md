# Encrypted archive data generated by older versions of `@sounisi5011/encrypted-archive`

This directory contains binary data generated using an older version of `@sounisi5011/encrypted-archive`. Its primary use is for [backward compatibility testing](../../tests/compatibility.ts).

## `plaintext.txt`

`plaintext.txt` is plain text data to be encrypted by `@sounisi5011/encrypted-archive`.
The content was generated by [Lipsum generator](https://www.lipsum.com/).

## `password.txt`

`password.txt` is the password used for encryption by `@sounisi5011/encrypted-archive`.

## `generate.cjs`

`generate.cjs` is a script that generates binary data for encrypted archives.

## `cleartext.txt`

Symbolic link to `plaintext.txt`. This exists for forward compatibility.

Since [#671], files containing plain text have been renamed to `plaintext.txt`.
This symbolic link is maintained for alternative implementations that require file structures from a time before [#671].
